/***************************************
Merge Sort:

An efficient, general-purpose, and coparison-based sorting
algorithm. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It
divides the input array into halves until it has n sublists,
then it repeatedly merges these sublists until there is only
one sublist remaining. This final sublist is the sorted list.
